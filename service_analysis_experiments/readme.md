To synchronize relevant data for these scripts I recommend installing google drive and having it sync the iOS Security - Sigil directory to the local machine.
Then set up a symbolic link called (i.e., ./data) in this directory which redirects to iOS Security - Sigil/Raw Data/ (be careful with spaces in file paths).

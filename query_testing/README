This directory contains a framework for testing our Prolog rules and some post processing scripts.

The rules and scripts here can be used by other scripts, but we should not copy them.
I recommend making symbolic links rather than copies if you want to reference these rules or scripts in another directory.

The general flow is as follows:
  cd into the scripts directory
  run ./allTests.sh
  This will run a series of tests, most of which use the testQueries.sh script.
  testQueries.sh then runs the respective test in tests.pl.
  tests.pl imports input from the prolog directory and then tries to satisfy goals that should only work if we wrote our Prolog rules correctly.
  The results of each test are then sorted and compared to the respective answer file in answers/

Note that order and duplicates of facts should not matter for the queries we are making, so we always use "sort | uniq" on our output and answers.

Before writing new tests, try to cd into scripts and run ./allTests.sh.
All of the tests should pass without any errors.
If there are errors, then Luke may have forgotten to push certain files to the git repo or your device is missing a dependency (e.g., swipl or the Prolog regex library).

Current status on dynamic analysis of file access:
reboot.sh: (This can be used for backup/restore. We will remove the reboot command)
- Prerequisites:
  - kill filemon process
  - remove filemon output file
- put a script in /Library/LaunchDaemons
  - this script will start filemon at boot time
- reboot device
- wait for the lack of ping
- wait for ping (this means we now have access to device)
- run a script that will that the RAW OUTPUT and make prologue facts
- IT WILL RUN UNTILL CTRL+C (maybe we can do something here)
- clean the device
  - kill process
  - remove files


logFileAccessObservations.sh:
- takes the N'th line from filemon output (this is a file access)
- gathers all the information needed
- there are some corner cases here (operation type has two words, etc)
- outputs to stdout a prolog fact
- the output is redirected from reboot.sh to output directory




----------------------------------

The other way we can do it:
- start another process at boot time that will process the filemon output
- copy com.iOracle.log.processes.plist to /Library/LaunchDaemons
- the problem is that the prolog file will be on the device and when a backup/restore
is performed, we will lose it.

test: unixParsing
Check for correct parsing of unix permissions from integer format to prolog friendly output of one fact per permission.

test: unixRootNone
Confirm that root user can still access files regardless of unix permissions.

test: invertedPermissions
purpose: Ask which files a process can access. Unix permissions assess user then group then other permissions. 
If the user matches but the permission is 0 the operation is denied. The same is true for group. 
This holds regardless of the other permissions. 
A file with 007 permissions is not accessible to the user owner or members of the group owner.

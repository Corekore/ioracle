*OS Internals Vol 1, page 406, directed me to a dynamic library stored at:
/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.xpcd/xpcd_cache.dylib
This dylib file contains a plist, but it needs to be extracted.
I used jtool to list each dynamic library (there should only be one) and then used jtool to extract that library.
At this point, you should be able to open the file on macOS, but to parse the plist with the plist python library, you must convert the plist to xml format.
I used plutil to perform the conversion from binary to xml format for the plist.

Which plist elements do we want to extract into prolog facts?

//Other data might be useful once we know more about app extensions.
//It's possible that none of these service identifiers are accessible to third party apps anyway.
AppExtensions
  executable path
  service identifier

LaunchDaemons
  MachServices
  ProgramArguments
    Item 0
  Program (this seems to be used sometimes instead of ProgramArguments)
  //Is this the user the daemon will run as? If so, it would be awesome for iOracle. I don't see BackupAgent listed... Why not? No mach services?
  UserName
  //What are LaunchEvents? Some documentation avaialable in 'man launchd.plist'. Suggests that these events can cause the daemon to be launched.
  //Can the working directories of these daemons be replace by sym links?
  WorkingDirectory
  RootDirectory
  //The Standard input and output paths look like predictable filepaths that might be good targets for symlinks. This is an iOracle style flaw though.
  //We might be able to crash some services by violating their hardresourcelimits, but I'm not sure that this is really a big deal.

SystemLibraryTreeState
  _imagePathToInfo
    some_file_path
      _serviceBundles
        Item 0
          executablePath
          _serviceIdentifier
          _infoPlist
            //Should be XPC!
            CFBundlePackageType
          _serviceDictionary
            _RoleAccount
            _AllowedClients

//The information in the sdk plist seems redundant with respect to the AppExtensions dictionary in the xpcd_cache plist.

Instructions for using SandScout to compile SBPL into Prolog.

Before running SandScout, you will need SBPL formatted sandbox profile files.
These can be acquired using SandBlaster or here:

sandscout_compiler.py 
This script is designed to take a single profile in sbpl format and compile it into prolog facts.
It relies on ply which is a python implementation of the compiler tools Lex and Yacc.
The python code needs to be badly refactored, but it does have a few comments.
  Usage: ./sandscout_compiler.py file_path_to_sbpl_profile.sb name_of_sandbox_profile > output_directory/name_of_profile.pl  

processAllProfiles.sh
This script takes a directory containing one of more sbpl files and runs sandscout_compiler.py on each sbpl file.
The result is an output file for each input file, and a consolidated output file with all the facts needed by iOracle.
sandscout_compiler.py should output error messages for each input file that it has trouble with.
  Usage: ./processAllProfiles.sh directoryContainingSBPLProfiles directoryToOutputTo fileToConsolidateFactsInto
  Example: ./processAllProfiles.sh SBPLProfiles/ prologFactsForProfiles/ ./allTheProfileFacts.pl

machFinder.cc is a small program that uses the mach API.
It uses the function mach_port_names to list the ports a process is using.
You have to pass in a process id number as an argument when running the program.

The current makefile cross compiles for armv7.
I don't know why, but if you try the program on an iOS device it segfaults.
Maybe the mach API is not fully functional on iOS or I am doing something wrong.

The program works on OS X.
To compile for OS X you can run this on an OS X device:
gcc machFinder.cc -o osXTest

# Automated Processing of iOracle Facts

These scripts are used for automated processing of iOracle Prolog facts. iOracle Prolog facts consist of static and dynamic analysis information. Then rules files are added. Scripts are basically Prolog queries that are run on facts for each iOS version.

## Location of Input Files

Prolog facts are in files that respect a given format. Prolog rules are in files in the iOracle repository. Both of these need to be defined in the `config` file.

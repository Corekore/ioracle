We want to run static analysis on files extracted from firmware images instead of just on the files extracted from physical devices.
This will allow us to analyze more iOS versions including versions we don't have devices for with jailbreaks we want to study (e.g. iOS 6.0, 7.0, 9.0).
  It seems that the jailbreaks with more documentation are the ones used on early versions of a major iOS version.

To process firmware files, we perform the following steps:
  download iOS firmware (is it an archive?)
  decrypt root file system
  convert .dmg to .img (confirm)
  mount the .img file (must be done on macOS)
    Example:
      hdiutil attach fs-img/iPad2,1_7.0.6_11B651.rootfs.img
  make a copy of the filesystem while preserving links, unix permissions, and other attributes
    Example:
      sudo cp -a /Volumes/InnsbruckTaos11B651.K93OS processed_rootfs_filesystems/
  (optional) 
    At this point we can try to extract some data about the file system such as unix permissions and other metadata.
    I'm not sure how helpful this will be, but there seems to be more data than I originally thought.
  move the archived file system to cascades for processing
    Example:
      scp fileSystem.tar.gz ladeshot@cascades.csc.ncsu.edu:/media/bigdata/firmware_file_systems/iOS_7.0.6_Firmware/
  extract the file system and perform initial analysis with a variant of the extracted file system extractor 
    This variant skips some vnode analysis that relies on metadata we don't collect unless we run the optional step mentioned above.
    Example:
      ./dataExtractorForFirmwareRootFS.sh /media/bigdata/firmware_file_systems/iOS_7.0.6_Firmware

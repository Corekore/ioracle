getfacl is a command line tool to get file access control lists on Mac OS X.

For further usage & license information please see the source code file getfacl.c.

On the command line use the -h flag to get a quick overview of available command line options:

getfacl -h

Luke's Note: 
  I found this project at https://github.com/jvscode/getfacl/blob/master/getfacl.c
  I found a commented section of code that suggested getting a library this way:
    curl -L -o membershipPriv.h 'http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/Libinfo/Libinfo-324.1/membership.subproj/membershipPriv.h?txt'
  I then changed the #include for that library to use quotes instead of brackets and loaded it in the same directory as the executable.
  Note that this code seems to use the MIT, Apple, and FreeBSD licenses

sandboxInitAnalysis.py is an IDA script that does backtracing to determine the value of X0 or R0 when sandbox_init or sandbox_apply_container are called.
This should tell us which sandbox profile an executable applies to itself.

mapIdaScriptToTargets.sh
This script maps an IDA script to a collection of ida databases representing disassembled executables.
Example Usage:
./mapIdaScriptToTargets.sh ./programsToAnalyze/hashedPathToFilePathMapping.csv ./sandboxInitAnalysis.py ./programsToAnalyze/

idaBatchAnalysis.sh
This script runs IDA's base analysis on several executables.
Example Usage:
./idaBatchAnalysis.sh pathsToSelfAppliedProfiles.out ~/iOracle/idaScripts/programsToAnalyze/

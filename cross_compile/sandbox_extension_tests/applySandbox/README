I have recorded my thought process the first time I did this in my journal.

This readme is to remind me of how I did this and to help any collaborators.

The first step is decrypting the application we want to sandbox.
Next, the app is moved into the same directory as system apps where it is not bound by container.
Then we rename the app and use a shim under the original name.
This shim calls the sandbox_exec program which wraps the app in a sandbox of our choice.

The Makefile will cross compile a c program to run on an iOS device.
We may need to change the target architecture depending on the device used.
The program created is called sandbox_exec.

Each app has a different shim with the right names in it.
I guess we could make this generic if we wanted to.

The .sb sandbox profile must be placed inside /usr/share/sandbox/ for the system to find it.
This directory may need to be created if it doesn't exist.
